### learn.ipynb - a python notebook for running all the different models we try on our data.
it consists of many code snippets that perform different actions on the data, in such a way that runnining some and ignoring others allows for many different combinations to test very quickly.

### makefile.py - a helper script for transforming the original data matrix(several pages of xlsx) to a more comfortable format for our learn.ipynb notebook(single file csv) with only the necessary data
